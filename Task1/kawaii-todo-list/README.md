I made this pink todo list webpage using HTML and CSS. It has round buttons and all the tasks sit in little cards. 
You can add, edit and delete tasks (just the design, it doesnt actually work yet). There is a cute bunny at the bottom. 
I built it to practice making designs from pictures into real webpages.

Output:

At first i struggled with arranging the div containers properly but after experimenting, i finally understood how they work. The CSS flex display was also tricky at the beginning but now i get it! My current challenge is making the webpage fit perfectly on phone screens, its too wide or gets cut off. I am studying more about responsive design (like @media queries) to fix this.
