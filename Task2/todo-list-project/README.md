To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple, responsive To-Do List web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 
It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them with ease. 
The application features a clean interface where each task displays a checkbox, the task name, and a delete button. 
Completed tasks are visually marked with a strikethrough. All tasks and their completion states are saved in **localStorage**. 
The project follows a structured folder layout with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
